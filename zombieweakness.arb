# arb is a ruby filetype, this is ruby code (been hooked since programing languages) :)
# my solution for the zombie problem, decided to add saving to a file which took up 90% of my time 
# fills a map of zombie types (keys) as Strings and their weaknesses (values) as an array of Strings 
# saves and recalls data from a csv file (example included)
# if you keep doing these design problems it might be interesting to make students make exe files as that was something
# I did not know how to do but needed to do right away when I started working on projects for non CS people
